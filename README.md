# Encyption-Decryption

In this project, I implemented and tested a Java application that attempts to decryptï¼Œthrough alphabet frequencies, a document that has been encrypted using a substitution cipher. And my program also estimate the accuracy of this approach using a technique called cross-validation.

Input documents should be plain-text files consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, whitespace, etc, which are all ASCII encoded. Examples for test is in corps file folder.
